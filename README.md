# Kickstarter_Challenge
## Project Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to support our client on the analysis of different Kickstarter campaigns to better support her fundraising efforts.
We were presented with data from over 4000 prior campaigns to analyze and provide meaningful insight about how she can better raise money
## Overview of Analysis
### Theater Campaigns
Our client specifically wanted to know how her theater campaigns performed related to their launch dates.  Dates for each campaign were provided in Unix timestamps so they had to be converted to and Excel format.  Using these dates, we were able to categorized each successful, failed and canceled theater campaign by the start month over several year.  
The resultant trends showed as follows:

The data show a clear trend for successful theater campaigns from May through July.  Not only are more campaigns launched, but the percentage of successful campaigns is higher.  November through January should be avoided as successful campaigns as a percentage of total campaigns trends much lower.
